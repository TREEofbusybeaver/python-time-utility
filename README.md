## 🚀 New in v2.0

- **Ghost Mode (Click-Through):** Make the widget completely unclickable. The text hollows out into a sleek outline, allowing you to click through it into your apps (Photoshop, VS Code, Games) while keeping the time visible.
- **Perimeter-Tracing Progress:** In Timer and Pomodoro modes, a dynamic visual progress line smoothly traces the perimeter of the widget as time depletes.
- **Command Center Control Panel:** A premium dark-mode settings dialog to control all aspects of the app.
- **Live Customization:** Use sliders to dynamically adjust Font Size, Accent Colors, Shadow Depth, Outline Thickness, and Rectangle Scale in real-time.
- **Persistent Settings:** All your UI and timer configurations are permanently saved between sessions.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Modes:** Clock, Stopwatch, Timer, and Pomodoro (Customizable Work/Break intervals).
- **Tactile Physics:** Dragging the widget compresses its drop shadow, mimicking physical depth.
- **System Tray Integration:** Run quietly in the background with full control from the Windows taskbar.
